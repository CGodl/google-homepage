Inspired by The Odin Project.

This project is an attempt at imitating the Google home page.

The purpose of this project is to understand web development and the relationship between HTML and CSS in web design.

The project is comprised of:

index.html - HTML code used
styles - Folder containing the CSS file for the project
images - Images used in the home page.
